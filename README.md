### codellm-nix 🚀

Welcome! This is a **Nix flake package** for [codellm](https://github.com/dvogeldev/codellm-nix), designed to make it easy to install and use the latest from [Abacus.AI](https://abacus.ai/) on **NixOS (Linux x86_64)** systems. 🎉

#### What is this? 🤔

This repo provides a Nix flake for installing `codellm` and its dependencies on NixOS. It’s tailored for **Linux x86_64** only—there is no support for ARM, macOS, Windows, or other platforms.

#### Features ✨

- **NixOS Integration**: Easily install `codellm` as a system package or in your user environment.
- **Latest Abacus.AI**: Pulls in the most recent Abacus.AI Python package.
- **Reproducible Builds**: Thanks to Nix flakes, you get consistent and reliable builds.
- **Linux x86_64 only**: No support for other architectures or operating systems.
- **Personal project**: Built for my own use, but you’re welcome to fork, adapt, and experiment! 🛠️

#### Installation 🖥️

1. **Enable flakes** on your NixOS system if you haven’t already. Add the following to your `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`:
   ```nix
   nix = {
     package = pkgs.nixFlakes;
     extraOptions = ''
       experimental-features = nix-command flakes
     '';
   };
   ```

2. **Add this flake** to your system configuration. In your `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`, include:
   ```nix
   {
     inputs.codellm.url = "github:dvogeldev/codellm-nix";

     outputs = { self, nixpkgs, codellm }: {
       nixosConfigurations.mySystem = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
         system = "x86_64-linux";
         modules = [
           {
             environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
               codellm.defaultPackage.x86_64-linux
             ];
           }
         ];
       };
     };
   }
   ```

3. **Rebuild your system**:
   ```sh
   sudo nixos-rebuild switch
   ```

4. **Use codellm**:
   Once installed, you can use `codellm` directly from your terminal. 🎯
